                            I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Concordia College, Moorhead. I received my Ph.D.
                            in Political Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
                            My research focuses on the dynamics of migration, gender, and political economy,
                            with a focus on East Asia and the Asian diaspora. 

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In my recent work published in <i>Comparative Political Studies</i>, developed from one of the empirical
                            chapters of my dissertation, I explore the relationship between gendered labor markets and gender differences 
                            in immigration attitudes in Japan. I find that women tend to oppose immigration more than men due to women's 
                            labor market vulnerabilities, highlighting the complexities of anti-immigrant sentiments and underscoring 
                            the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in immigration policy. 
                            In other chapters of my dissertation, I examine attitudes toward climate refugees in South Korea and 
                            toward the Asian diaspora in Australia and the United States, using survey experiments and text analysis.
                            Currently, I am working on several projects, including examining attitudes and policy preferences related to 
                            migrant workers in East Asia as well as undocumented immigrants in the United States.

                            My research has been supported by the APSA Summer Centennial Center Research Grant, 
                            the NSF-APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG), 
                            the UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC) Dissertation Fellowship, 
                            the UCLA Initiative to Study Hate (ISH) Research Innovation Fund, 
                            and the Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies, among others.
                            I hold a master's degree in International Relations from Seoul National 
                            University and a Bachelor's degree in International Relations from the 
                            Australian National University.
