                        Gendered Interpretations of Immigration: Gender Differences in Attitudes Toward Immigrants and
                        Labor Market Vulnerability

                        <b>Abstract:</b> This study delves into the gender differences in attitudes toward immigrants, highlighting gendered interpretation as key to understanding immigration attitudes. It argues that gender differences in immigration attitudes do not necessarily reflect innate tolerance levels but are instead influenced by their employment situations and vulnerabilities within the labor market. Drawing on data from an original survey of Japanese nationals with embedded experiments, as well as existing surveys, this study finds that information emphasizing the economic necessity of immigrants leads to increased favorability among male respondents, but not female respondents. Additionally, women, especially those in non-professional jobs, show increased hostility toward female immigrants when exposed to such information. The findings underscore the need to consider the interplay of gender and labor market vulnerability, contributing to literature on immigration attitudes and gender politics. The research also highlights the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in immigration policy, particularly in countries with significant gender inequalities.
